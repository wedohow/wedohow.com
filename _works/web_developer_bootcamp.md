      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>With this bootcamp we intend to address the needs of people of all ages who want to learn the fundamentals of web development.

      <br><br>This program appeals to IT graduates or engineers who have just started their career in a web development environment.
      <br><br>We follow an in-depth approach to hands-on teaching here. We cover all the basic modules that must be conquered by well versed engineers and will help them continuously improve and derive greater pleasure from their work.</p>

      <h3><i>Three months of work and fun</i></h3>
      </center>
      <p></p>
      <p>The duration of the bootcamp is <b>three months</b> of intensive <b>work</b> and <b>fun</b>.</p>
      <p>We've separated the content to sections that we think represent the intention behind the respective content.</p>
      <p>The duration of each section ranges from two to four weeks and one can attend each of them regardless of the rest of the program.</p>
      <p>Thus, our view of how a well thought bootcamp should be is illustrated by these <b>five modules</b>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Know your tools</li>
        <li>Know your environment</li>
        <li>Know your language</li>
        <li>Start building</li>
        <li>Meet the world</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Know your tools</h3>
      <p>In this module the participants will learn to work with three very important tools of every engineer. We refer to git, the terminal and the editor. The module has a duration of <b>5 sessions</b> with the following content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 2 lectures about <code>git</code></li>
        <li> 1 lecture about code editors</li>
        <li> 1 session about the terminal</li>
        <li> 1 revision session with exercises and additional material</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>Know your environment</h3>
      <p>In this module, participants will be introduced to the Web, the <code>HTTP</code> protocol, Application Program Interfaces (APIs), Unix, and Databases, which together make up the environment for developing web applications. The module has <b>6 sessions</b> and lasts two weeks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Web 101</li>
        <li> APIs 101</li>
        <li> Unix 101</li>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>Know your language</h3>
      <p>In this section we will focus on the <code>Javascript</code> programming language. The duration of the module is <b>2 weeks</b> and the best description we can give is that of an intensive crash course in the concepts of the language as well as a presentation of the <code>React</code> framework.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript basic features</li>
        <li>Web API</li>

    <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
      <h3>Start building</h3>
      <p>This is - in our humble opinion - <b>the most interesting section</b> of the Camp. This is where things are getting real. After all, we are <b>Hands On</b>!</p>
      <p>This section includes bringing a real web development project to life or fixing some bugs in an open source repository. The duration is approximately <b>4 weeks</b>.</p>
      <p>Some topics that will be developed in this module include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript basic features</li>
        <li>Web API</li>
        <li>Introduction to React</li>

    <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>Meet the world</h3>
      <p>This final section includes advice to candidates for technical technical interviews, how to set up a resume, and the roles participants will be asked to take on in the future. It lasts 2 weeks and covers the following topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technincal interviewing</li>
        <li>Technical orientation</li>

      <br>
      <p>
        As can be seen from the above, our Web Developer Camp covers quite a lot. It is intensive, it is challenging, it is demanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it is also <b>fun</b> and it will provide participants an unforgettable <b>real-world working experience</b>. 
      </p>
      

      Last but not least: We can tailor our camp to your needs. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> and learn more about availability, cost and whatever else comes to mind.
