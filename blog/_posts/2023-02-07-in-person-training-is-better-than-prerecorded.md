When it comes to IT corporate training, it's crucial to ensure that employees receive the best possible education. The future of a company depends on the skills and knowledge of its employees, and the right training can make a significant difference in terms of productivity and success. This is why at HOW, we believe in in-person training instead of pre-recorded videos. Mind you, in-person does not mean on-site. In-person in the post-covid era has transformed to virtual and distributed. You can have access to the same training quality from the comfort of your couch at home.

1. Interactive
</blockquote>
Pre-recorded videos can be convenient and easily accessible, but they lack the personal touch and interaction that is crucial for effective learning. In an in-person training session, instructors can respond to questions and provide tailored guidance based on the needs of each individual learner. This allows employees to receive personalized attention and ensure that their specific questions and concerns are addressed.

2. Collaborative
</blockquote>
Moreover, in-person training provides a collaborative environment that promotes learning and engagement. Participants can interact with one another, share their experiences, and work together to solve problems. This type of collaborative learning has been shown to be more effective than solitary learning, as it increases motivation and enhances retention of information.

3. Hands On
</blockquote>
Participants can work with the latest tools and technologies, practice what they have learned, and receive feedback from the instructors in real-time. This type of practical learning helps employees to retain information and apply their new skills on the job.

<blockquote class="blockquote single-quote">
4. Community
</blockquote>
Finally, in-person training can help to build relationships and foster a sense of community among employees. By participating in the learning process together, employees can learn from one another and build a network of support. This sense of community can help to promote collaboration and teamwork, and can lead to a more positive and productive work environment.

In conclusion, at HOW, we believe that in-person training is the key to effective IT corporate education. By providing personalized attention, promoting collaborative learning, offering hands-on experiences, and fostering a sense of community, we ensure that employees receive the best possible education and are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed. Be sure to check out our <a href="/projects/it-recruitment-school">IT Recruitment School</a> and our <a href="/projects/web-developer-bootcamp">Web Developer Camp</a>. Both these programs focus on Hands On Work and stay away from theoretical concepts and boring lectures. Or at least we hope so.
