Recently, a client of ours reached out to us with a question about how they could learn more about data science. This client was a business professional who had heard a lot about the importance of machine learning and wanted to add it to their platform, but didn't have a technical background. They wanted to know if there were any resources available that would allow them to learn about data science without having to get into the technical weeds.

This experience made us realise that there are many people out there who are interested in data science but don't know where to start. Data is all around us, and the amount of data being generated is growing exponentially with each passing day. But, to make sense of this data and derive meaningful insights, one needs to have an understanding of data science. While data science is often thought of as a technical field, it doesn't have to be that way. There are plenty of resources available for non-technical people who want to learn how to analyse data and gain valuable insights from it.
