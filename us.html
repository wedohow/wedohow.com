    <h2>Dimitris Kotsakos</h2>
    <p>
      Engineering Management is my day job. Wannapreneur @ our own thing is my
      other job. Having worked for the leading marketplace in Greece
      (Skroutz.gr), Twitter and Telefonica Research, it's been some years since
      I first thought of building something myself. HOW is our WIP.

      A generalist with a wide range of crafts and interests. I have been a
      member of the greek Ruby community since its very early days, I have been
      building and leading teams for more than one decade. My main areas of
      interest are software development, engineering management and
      organisational behaviour (strategic, operational, and people).

    <h2>Mike Zaby</h2>
    <p>
      Software Engineer with a can-do attitude and a love for clean code, design
      patterns and software architecture. I believe in the importance of knowing
      the fundamentals of the whole stack I'm working with. When I don't craft
      code, I'm crafting coffee and music.
